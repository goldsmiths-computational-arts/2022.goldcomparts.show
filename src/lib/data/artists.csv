The Blob. 
The user is driven to satisfy an agent of The Blob by its constant need for attention. In doing so the user comes to understand the futility of their actions and also their consequences. For every time the agent is satisfied by user interaction, it sends out data on social media for The Blob to feed on.

Current work visualises the obfuscation of the +IBg-real+IBk- impacts of the internet by agents of surveillance capitalism. Often playful, these visualisations both reveal and hide these obfuscated realities, using the hidden aspects to start conversation around the intentionality surrounding what is undisclosed. Machine learning, physical computing and creative coding techniques have been used in recent works.

It is London that is filmed, it is used as a material, an alphabet with which a language is built. Code is incorporated into the structure of the stories, guided by an Object Oriented Programming methodology. 
This work is about what happens when a language is hybridised with another.
The spectator never sees the character, they discover them through their perception of the city, and a voice+AC0-over narration of one of a thousand tales. 
The purpose is to question how computation can be used to generate a grammar, with cities as an alphabet for a new language.
Programming here allows us to get close an important aspect of cities. The fact that they are hard to grasp as a homogeneous entity, and that they are asynchronous, they hold at the same moment an infinite number of possibilities and experiences. 
Code allows to convey this fundamental idea. Instead of developing a way to grasp its complexity, it instead shows a reality: cities are not graspable in a glance, and it is part of what makes them fascinating.
It is also about using technology within the production of mediums that are already widely democratised and part of our common imaginaries. It doesn+IBk-t challenge them with new imagery, but in the edition and production itself.

Employing a procedurally generated terrain, slowly decaying over time, Steward records images of this landscape as vignettes printed out as postcards.

Leverton's work investigates systemic collapse through installation and performance. Utilising robotics, machine learning and computer vision, Leverton constructs dynamic relationships between audiences and their environment to question their role in its collapse. Through this lens Leverton seeks to develop analogies to the fractal self+AC0-similar systems that govern our societies and environment. By creating systems that are designed to fail, he aims to draw attention to the compulsory participation within a global economy that is destroying both our planet and our societies.+ACI-,+ACI-https://drive.google.com/open?id+AD0-1HeSnwGtlOD4meekq15MO+AC0-P7TYKkG2B5F+ACI-,+ACI-Generative design, procedural art, interactive, game engine, shaders+ACI-,+ACI-https://drive.google.com/open?id+AD0-1Qha1RvLJjNW+AC0-Ni+AF8-BjvOu3qAOZNTyyML+AC0-, https://drive.google.com/open?id+AD0-1GxNLGwhSAmJdMK38Hyy5jQkF8mwq7Xkl, https://drive.google.com/open?id+AD0-1Lz8DpbQ54JNpx8A3j0bH25sSdU1qlbbX+ACI-,+ACI-robinleverton+ACI-,+ACI-robinlevertonart.com+ACI-,+ACI-+ACI-,+ACI-https://vimeo.com/user158614322+ACI-,+ACI-robinlevertonart+AEA-gmail.com+ACI-,+ACI-A bearded man with sexy+AC0-cool hair, wearing a black t+AC0-shirt standing in front of a white wall+ACI-,+ACI-A 3D rendered landscape featuring a river running through reeds and grass with a bright blue sky and black blocks floating+ACI-,+ACI-A 3D rendered landscape featuring a river running through reeds and grass with a bright blue sky and black blocks floating+ACI-,+ACI-A 3D rendered landscape featuring a river running through reeds and grass with a bright blue sky and black blocks floating+ACI-

Closeness Quenches is an interactive installation created by combining Arduino with Max MSP. Upon entering the space, one hears distant, abstract sounds while spotting a statue inside an irregularly shaped transparent case. As soon as the viewer comes close to the statue, smoke fills the inside of the case, making it impossible to detect the exact shape of the statue. Simultaneously, voices start emerging, some attempting to describe to the viewer what the statue looks like, others lying about it or not even making statements related to the statue. The closer one is, the more nebulous their perception of the statue becomes.

+AC0- Annie Dorsen

The aim of this project is to probe Dorsen+IBk-s question by creating a visual and auditory immersive environment that produces a state of both over+AC0- and under+AC0- determination.

A (near) real+AC0-time stream of images captured from Twitter is compiled and project large, so that the viewer+IBk-s peripheral vision is completely filled. The timing of the images is such that the viewer is only able to register them in retrospect, such that there is induced a feeling of constant psychological lag, which is never able to be resolved. This effect induces in the viewer a feeling of anxiety +AC0ALQ- both of agoraphobia (as the images and meaning constantly retreat from their mental grasp), and of claustrophobia (as they are buried beneath the unending deluge of imagery and potential meaning). With all contextual cues removed the viewer is left disorientated within a sea of images which become both immanent and transcendent.+ACI-,+ACI-Jay Treagus is a visual artist and researcher. 
Operating in the spaces +IBg-between+IBk- +AC0- particularly those opened by marginal technologies such as occultism and the trans+AC0-temporal rhetoric of afro+AC0-futurism +AC0- they explore the relationships between technology, belief and contemporary knowledge making.

Their work includes both digital and physical artefacts, installation, performance, and site specific interventions, as well as academic and fictive (hyper)texts. These forms coalesce around a post+AC0-factual position, which regards mythology, conspiracy and esotericism as immersive technologies in their own right, and the attempt to understand the ways in which they can be leveraged to do work in the world. This is a stance, which is at its heart, is concerned with developing practical tools for survival in a world which consistently defies rationalist projects of mastery.

Examples of this include flocking birds or shoals of fish where each individual creature is guided only by the movements of its immediate neighbours and yet they produce vast dynamic shapes as a group. The simplicity of the rules and the resultant organic beauty has attracted coders and artists to emulate the behaviour +AC0- with a famous example being Craig Reynolds' +ACIAIg-Boids+ACIAIg-. A step further from this is +ACIAIg-Self Organised Criticality+ACIAIg- where simple local interactions cause a system to move into a steady state, resulting in the formation of macro structures. The most famous example of this would be termite and ant colonies. 

In this piece, a system of creatures that move and leave a pheromone trail behind them is created. The direction of each creature's movement depends on the intensity of +ACIAIg-pheromones+ACIAIg- in their immediate vicinity, allowing for each creature to guide and be guided by the other creatures. This feedback loop emergently creates a structured pheromone map purely from the small interactions. Crucial to this and the natural systems mentioned above is the amount of creatures in the system +AC0- with too few creatures, the system will be unstable and random, but with enough creatures, the randomness falls to spontaneous structure.

By interacting with the piece your motion and presence will unavoidably disturb the natural process of the creatures and their environment until they are no longer able to survive. +ACI-,+ACI-Louie Hext is a computational artist and developer, whose recent work involves creating physically generative systems and exploring complexity through interactive technologies.

Our brain, through time, morphs, and so do our memories. 

The project is an interactive installation with multiple pieces that place the spectator in the position of a close family member with dementia by inhabiting an interactive white living room where his memories are present through light. It uses technology but also combines analogue pieces. Portraits around the space get distorted with human presence or action. Going against the idea of Cornell's permanency of the photographic image in time, the pieces in this installation unfix pictures and give the possibility to deteriorate, distort, change, and disappear as happens to us human beings. These are portraits more like life itself. 

The project is also an allegory between our brain and the computer. It uses coding software in parallelism to the nervous system. Code is used to morph new images by overlapping pixels between archive family photographs. Memories are also personal self+AC0-constructions. Therefore, live images/videos are obtained from the spectator transforming the portraits. Finally, a pixel analogue version is also part of the installation in a puzzle game. This time, instead of using a computational morphing code, the film records a person with dementia playing the puzzle. To decode and visualise the images, the spectator must place the white cubes on the projections, following up the steps of a person with memory loss and therefore experiencing and embodying his performance. 

In this installation, all constructions through deconstructions belong to a cyclical process to create a valid reality of atemporal memories. Therefore, there is no correct or incorrect portrait, all of them are possible. +ACI-,+ACI-Maria Gracia Cebrecos is a Peruvian multidisciplinary developing artist with a practice in a mix of documentary+-fiction photography and a background in architecture. Combining these two, she is motivated to tell sensible stories through multiple mediums and the action of inhabiting a place. Therefore, her latest practice focus on creating multi+AC0-sensorial experiences through physical and interactive installations, where the performance in time and space plays an essential role. 

Her collection of work revolves around intimate experiences, memory, identity, culture, mythology and nature. She is interested in questioning the construction of what we normalised as +IBw-reality+IB0- and it's many possible valid interpretations. She is using technology to develop this variations but also to reconnect us with that sensorial aspect that is essential for humanity. 

In the past, she worked in architecture, photography and education in a University in the Design Department. She has been a finalist in several national and international photography grants. In 2021, she won the Catalyst prize by IC Visual Lab, and her work was shown Bristol Photo Festival.

The richer the environment, the more present you become. Her current research into the quantum model explores brain and heart coherence by collecting data from the user in VR which is then interpreted in the 3D world.+ACI-,,+ACI-VR, meditative, quantum model+ACI-,+ACI-https://drive.google.com/open?id+AD0-1JLnQWbOwbH6LXqjUWb7mgpxz3qb27ixs, https://drive.google.com/open?id+AD0-1c+AF8-r3GNONxb698FZ+AF8-nONe1+AF8-kt+AF8-dCoIUau, https://drive.google.com/open?id+AD0-1svenInCsIwjpwrEbgVgyzQQtv8lU6mjB+ACI-,+ACI-lucylara+ACI-,+ACI-www.lucylaramartin.co.uk+ACI-,+ACI-+ACI-,+ACI-https://vimeo.com/user51962018+ACI-,+ACI-lucylmartin+AEA-hotmail.com+ACI-,,,,
