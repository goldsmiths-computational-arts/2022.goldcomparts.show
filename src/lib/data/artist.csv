This work is about what happens when a language is hybridised with another.
The spectator never sees the character, they discover them through their perception of the city, and a voice-over narration of one of a thousand tales. 
The purpose is to question how computation can be used to generate a grammar, with cities as an alphabet for a new language.
Programming here allows us to get close an important aspect of cities. The fact that they are hard to grasp as a homogeneous entity, and that they are asynchronous, they hold at the same moment an infinite number of possibilities and experiences. 
Code allows to convey this fundamental idea. Instead of developing a way to grasp its complexity, it instead shows a reality: cities are not graspable in a glance, and it is part of what makes them fascinating.
It is also about using technology within the production of mediums that are already widely democratised and part of our common imaginaries.

Simultaneously, voices start emerging, some attempting to describe to the viewer what the statue looks like, others lying about it or not even making statements related to the statue.

The terms that describe wallowing in internet culture (deep dive, clickhole, etc) indeed suggest a spiraling down into depths—despite the obvious lack of depth to the screens we use. Is there such a thing as depth to a sequential series of flat images?” 
- Annie Dorsen

The aim of this project is to probe Dorsen’s question by creating a visual and auditory immersive environment that produces a state of both over- and under- determination.

A (near) real-time stream of images captured from Twitter is compiled and project large, so that the viewer’s peripheral vision is completely filled. The timing of the images is such that the viewer is only able to register them in retrospect, such that there is induced a feeling of constant psychological lag, which is never able to be resolved. This effect induces in the viewer a feeling of anxiety -- both of agoraphobia (as the images and meaning constantly retreat from their mental grasp), and of claustrophobia (as they are buried beneath the unending deluge of imagery and potential meaning). With all contextual cues removed the viewer is left disorientated within a sea of images which become both immanent and transcendent.
""","""Jay Treagus is a visual artist and researcher. 
Operating in the spaces ‘between’ - particularly those opened by marginal technologies such as occultism and the trans-temporal rhetoric of afro-futurism - they explore the relationships between technology, belief and contemporary knowledge making.

Their work includes both digital and physical artefacts, installation, performance, and site specific interventions, as well as academic and fictive (hyper)texts. These forms coalesce around a post-factual position, which regards mythology, conspiracy and esotericism as immersive technologies in their own right, and the attempt to understand the ways in which they can be leveraged to do work in the world. This is a stance, which is at its heart, is concerned with developing practical tools for survival in a world which consistently defies rationalist projects of mastery.

They hold an MA in Digital Media from Goldsmiths University, and are currently awaiting the publication of their first paper.

Examples of this include flocking birds or shoals of fish where each individual creature is guided only by the movements of its immediate neighbours and yet they produce vast dynamic shapes as a group. The simplicity of the rules and the resultant organic beauty has attracted coders and artists to emulate the behaviour - with a famous example being Craig Reynolds' ""Boids"". A step further from this is ""Self Organised Criticality"" where simple local interactions cause a system to move into a steady state, resulting in the formation of macro structures. The most famous example of this would be termite and ant colonies.  

In this piece, a system of creatures that move and leave a pheromone trail behind them is created. The direction of each creature's movement depends on the intensity of ""pheromones"" in their immediate vicinity, allowing for each creature to guide and be guided by the other creatures. This feedback loop emergently creates a structured pheromone map purely from the small interactions. Crucial to this and the natural systems mentioned above is the amount of creatures in the system - with too few creatures, the system will be unstable and random, but with enough creatures, the randomness falls to spontaneous structure.

By interacting with the piece your motion and presence will unavoidably disturb the natural process of the creatures and their environment until they are no longer able to survive.

Our brain, through time, morphs, and so do our memories. 

The project is an interactive installation with multiple pieces that place the spectator in the position of a close family member with dementia by inhabiting an interactive white living room where his memories are present through light. It uses technology but also combines analogue pieces. Portraits around the space get distorted with human presence or action. Going against the idea of Cornell's permanency of the photographic image in time, the pieces in this installation unfix pictures and give the possibility to deteriorate, distort, change, and disappear as happens to us human beings. These are portraits more like life itself. 

The project is also an allegory between our brain and the computer. It uses coding software in parallelism to the nervous system. Code is used to morph new images by overlapping pixels between archive family photographs. Memories are also personal self-constructions. Therefore,  live images/videos are obtained from the spectator transforming the portraits. Finally, a pixel analogue version is also part of the installation in a puzzle game. This time, instead of using a computational morphing code, the film records a person with dementia playing the puzzle. To decode and visualise the images, the spectator must place the white cubes on the projections, following up the steps of a person with memory loss and therefore experiencing and embodying his performance. 

In this installation, all constructions through deconstructions belong to a cyclical process to create a valid reality of atemporal memories. Therefore, there is no correct or incorrect portrait, all of them are possible. ""","""Maria Gracia Cebrecos is a Peruvian multidisciplinary developing artist with a practice in a mix of documentary+fiction photography and a background in architecture. Combining these two, she is motivated to tell sensible stories through multiple mediums and the action of inhabiting a place.

And finding a way to escape from 3D physical reality to get into a more alpha state. My intention is to create a breathing sensor which trigger certain events in unity  the more coherent the breath. I have meditative binaural sound that I have created that I intend to loop with some parts being really distorted – almost like you are tripping out to see if this triggers different breathing patterns. The user in the VR headset will be embodied to a digital avatar lying down but able to see around what happens to their external environment when they are breathing in a more coherent manor. The audience will see the avatar from a different perspective. They will look up at the projection (almost as if they are looking up to their higher consciousness) then the projections will be from a perspective of looking down at the avatar. This will enable the audience to see what the digital avatar is doing in the headset and how their breathe affects the scene. Also meaning that not all audience members have to participate in the headset.""","""Lucy is a creative technologist whose core focus is on virtual reality, a medium that enables her to explore space-time, time-space.
