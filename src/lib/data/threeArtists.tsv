0	Yasmin L Jones		she/her	yjone001	The Blob	Revealing The Blob.	The Blob is a two part installation in which the viewer indirectly interacts with the network of actors that own our data and control our online interactions through techniques of surveillance capitalism, aka. The Blob.  The user is driven to satisfy an agent of The Blob by its constant need for attention. In doing so the user comes to understand the futility of their actions and also their consequences. For every time the agent is satisfied by user interaction, it sends out data on social media for The Blob to feed on.  The disgusting Blob grows as it’s fed and relies on its agents to facilitate its feeding - an endless cycle of attention and data consumption.	Yasmin L Jones creates interactive installations and post-photographic objects exploring who or what shapes the digital realm. Current work visualises the obfuscation of the ‘real’ impacts of the internet by agents of surveillance capitalism. Often playful, these visualisations both reveal and hide these obfuscated realities, using the hidden aspects to start conversation around the intentionality surrounding what is undisclosed. Machine learning, physical computing and creative coding techniques have been used in recent works. Yasmin holds an undergraduate degree in photography from Birmingham City University, and has recently completed the Tropical Lab international student artists programme in Singapore.	https://drive.google.com/open?id=1dNCsD2l0VUuFIQV82L9PNdh5WghB8ifL	API, Twitter, Social media, Node.js, Installation, Surveillance Capitalism, The Blob, Internet, Power	https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RqfA0bNz--9TBhfSxp5zwETkW0J1S21i, https://drive.google.com/open?id=1VS73FQeGDRNtifpE72caoaw7_OSXd-q4	yasminljones	https://yasminljones.myportfolio.com/		https://vimeo.com/yasminljonesvimeo	yasminljones@outlook.com

The works published under the alias Quarck deal with sociological themes and the interaction between reality and digitality, the search for new interweavings of different topics such as the creation of digital worlds and interactions relevant to everyday life. The artistic exploration and endeavour, the fascination for the incomprehensible, the discovery of new production and interaction possibilities drive him. Quarck moves freely in terms of media, but design and creation on the computer remain the most important elements for him.	https://drive.google.com/open?id=1GglQoS3iUSgUoflbufVG6cNkxZOFRCIy	Unreal engine, real time data, metaverse	https://drive.google.com/open?id=1LodHnTDlYF8xdwymaxPAol3RNZO_Coly, https://drive.google.com/open?id=1jGO9ickjQHgJBjsjjGQfmhI0SwbPoLWR, https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ecokkgD26UePfBokgxLdZv6CWxayMZa0	quarck.studio	https://quarck.ch/	https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSFE0ucUrs475Vyo5HOIzEA	https://vimeo.com/quarckquarck	sebi@quarck.ch				
2	Lucy Martin	Lucy Martin	she/her	lmart017	Coherance	A brain and heart coherence VR installation	My final project is based on brain and heart coherence. And finding a way to escape from 3D physical reality to get into a more alpha state. My intention is to create a breathing sensor which trigger certain events in unity  the more coherent the breath. I have meditative binaural sound that I have created that I intend to loop with some parts being really distorted – almost like you are tripping out to see if this triggers different breathing patterns. The user in the VR headset will be embodied to a digital avatar lying down but able to see around what happens to their external environment when they are breathing in a more coherent manor. The audience will see the avatar from a different perspective. They will look up at the projection (almost as if they are looking up to their higher consciousness) then the projections will be from a perspective of looking down at the avatar. This will enable the audience to see what the digital avatar is doing in the headset and how their breathe affects the scene. Also meaning that not all audience members have to participate in the headset.	Lucy is a creative technologist whose core focus is on virtual reality, a medium that enables her to explore space-time, time-space. The richer the environment, the more present you become. Her current research into the quantum model explores brain and heart coherence by collecting data from the user in VR which is then interpreted in the 3D world.
