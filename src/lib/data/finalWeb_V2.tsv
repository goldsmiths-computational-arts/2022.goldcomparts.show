2	Alexandra Pfammatter	Alexandra Pfammatter	she/her	equine.zygote	An artistic intervention and research project that explores intimacy under surveillance capitalism trough data sharing between personal devices.	"If located in the same physical space, smartphones constantly and indirectly exchange information with each other. Our own devices datafy us and transmit those fractions to be received and interpreted by other apparatuses. Such exchanges culminate in the creation of a whole new data profile: defined trough both external influences and locally gathered user information. 'Profiles' that ultimately shape how we are perceived in a digital environment and are reflected back to us in the form of recommendations and personalised content.

'equine.zygote' explores those connections and how they impact our experience within a networked, but highly situated and monetised space. The central piece of the work is a cellphone that has been exclusively used to interact with horse related content of various kinds. If a visitor decides to interact with the piece, two mechanics are set into motion: First, the cell will visualise the data exchange between itself and the visitor's device in real-time. Furthermore, their phones are likely to become 'contaminated' through the subsequent data stream. The results of that вЂ“ an inevitable emergence of personalised ads, recommended videos or pop-ups that are horse themed вЂ“ can be submitted to a web server. There, they are added to an ever-growing archive in an effort to unravel the web of interpersonal connections within the blackbox of surveillance capitalism. Through this interaction, the visitors become an elementary part of the research and artwork themselves.

By exploring the accessibility and legibility of data or examining different perceptive and cognitive frameworks, her works reveal how such tensions create social and political asymmetries. Trough the manipulation of mediums, algorithmic processes and platforms, Pfammatter re-appropriates strategies of visibility and invisibility to revert those dynamics of control. By questioning assumption and meaning she subtly challenges the hidden structures that underlie our contemporary networked realities."	alexandra_pfammatter	alexandrapfammatter.com			info@alexandrapfammatter.com	A computer vision algorithm labelling the rabbitвЂ“duck illusion as 'animal' and 'flightless bird'	A personalised ad for a print on demand shop which let's you write your on a sweater with a glittery horse silhouette.

"Amber is a Turks & Caicos Islander with a Fine Arts background. Her work centres around the ways technology extends our perceptions of ourselves and invites viewers to question their own cognitive processes in order to find hidden links between the work and their lives. 

Her main interest is in creating platforms for public participation where the physical involvement of the viewer changes the visual identity of the piece. Most recently, her work has moved away from bio-data visualisation towards text-based art, both in its generative and sculptural forms by sourcing data from APIs instead of sensors.

"Mandelbulb is a classical three-dimensional fractal shape; from iteration and evolution, the infinite loop generates million of intricate detail and elaborate form. I try to explore this potential shape by changing the variables, equations or coordinates to generate various shapes. Through collecting thousands of images, the new mandelbulbs have been regenerated by A.I. Away from the orders and rules, the shapes are now no longer symmetric or algorithm-driven and become a new product of integration.

This idea came from the Chaos theory; the scientific theory focuses on the underlying pattern and rule that were once regarded as randomness and disorder. From Butterfly Effect to Fractal, the unpredictability led by small change and building the regime poised between order and chaos, they work collaboratively, confuse each other, and appear everywhere. This project aims to explore the balance between both and keep pushing the border by the complexity.

The spectator never sees the main protagonist, instead they discover them through their perception of the built environment and a voice-over narration of one of a thousand tales.The narrative structure is common to all, with infinite variations. 

Architecture is used as a material, an alphabet with which a language is constructed. Code is incorporated into the structure of the stories, it becomes its grammar. 
This project is about what happens when a language is hybridised with another. 

The  video installation is a spatial translation of the project, an extension of its logic.
In the space you are about to enter two cities are facing each others. You will never visit the city of the person seating next to you."	"Before completing an MFA in Computational Arts at the University of Goldsmiths, Eden was trained in architecture in Paris and Madrid. 
Instead of building the physical environment, her practice now focuses on constructing narrative tools, with cities as a subject and space as a material. She investigates human experiences of inhabiting places, to answer the question: what remains of architecture when it becomes a memory? 
 
With writing at its core, her work matches diverse techniques and media to imagine new tools by combining fixed and moving images, spatial and sound installations, physical computing, interactive fictions, XR."	eden_chahal				chahaleden@gmail.com	Profile of women in black and white	Screenshot from the movie 	Screenshot from the movie 	Screenshot from the movie 	Sub_ system 1: Narrative Memories

[It is] a sublime that descends, in contrast to Kant's imagery of elevation, lift and raising over or above. The terms that describe wallowing in internet culture (deep dive, clickhole, etc) indeed suggest a spiralling down into depthsвЂ”despite the obvious lack of depth to the screens we use. Is there such a thing as depth to a sequential series of flat images?""[1]

At the start of the twenty-first century, it was common for the peoples of many cultures around the globe to regularly access вЂsocial mediaвЂ™. These networked digital platforms allowed individuals to access and contribute to vast libraries of data, with some studies estimating that around 2,500,000,000 GB were created daily[2]. 

So much information would have been impossible to keep up with or rationally interpret, instead it is thought that the unyielding content stream was used as a meditative aid, allowing individuals glimpses into the transcendental scale at which the world really operated, far beyond human conception.

This work, made possible through collaboration with the Lambent Institute, invites you to sit a while, and meditate on these images as our forebears may once have done.

Energy then broadens from the body allowing you to feel an enfolding sense of liberation and transformation. This VR piece guides you through breathwork to open your heart space and see how this affects your physical reality. Through building quantum coherence, we allow ourselves to get out of the known and into the unknown, where all possibilities exist.

We might not be losing our memories; they are just morphing.  "	"Maria Gracia Cebrecos is a Peruvian multidisciplinary developing artist with a practice in a mix of documentary+fiction photography and a background in architecture. Combining these two, she is motivated to tell sensible stories through multiple mediums and the action of inhabiting a place. Therefore, her latest practice focus on creating multi-sensorial experiences through physical and interactive installations, where the performance in time and space plays an essential role.  

Her collection of work revolves around intimate experiences, memory, identity, culture, mythology and nature. She is interested in questioning the construction of what we normalised as вЂњrealityвЂќ and it's many possible valid interpretations. She is using technology to develop this variations but also to reconnect us with that sensorial aspect that is essential for humanity.  

In the past, she worked in architecture, photography and education in a University in the Design Department. She has been a finalist in several national and international photography grants. In 2021, she won the Catalyst prize by IC Visual Lab, and her work was shown Bristol Photo Festival.

MexicoвЂ™s economy was increasing slowly in the recent years, benefiting only some, while social disparity increased as well.  One hundred years ago, Diego Rivera referred to corruption and D.A. Siqueiros painted politicians as clowns.  This reality has not changed.  A country tired of old corrupt practices and extreme conditions is a green field for populism, which leads to more poverty and social disruption.  Violence initiated by drug cartels is the perfect excuse for a military state.  People are forced to migrate within two different realities.  In a country where last names provide better chances than effort, some will always be advantaged, due to monopolies or a corrupt government.  Among the most underprivileged are indigenous minorities, and women.  Technology is not only our new window to see the world, but also a hope to provide access and balance.  This computational work pretends to set a moment of reflection on a problem that is not only local, as every problem today is a global problem."

This piece is part of a research project exploring the development and histories of gendered labour and knowledge through the framing of womenвЂ™s work within the domestic realm, its ties to computing, and tensions between art and craft.

Loose threads invites you to lie on the bed beneath a canopy made by the artistвЂ™s Nonna, touch the blue stitching on the quilt to listen to the artistвЂ™s mother tell stories of women in their family, and watch a projection from Tasmania, Australia of a near identical quilt made by MarisaвЂ™s mother in the process of teaching her how to make the one in the space.

The quilt is patched with printed images of women contributing to the history of computing -  collected from the feminist server AnarachaServer - and of women from MarisaвЂ™s family. The design is based on an Anni AlbersвЂ™ wall hanging and includes an IBM punch card pattern encoded with a quote from the first computer programmer, Ada Lovelace.

Sitting as if for a painter to sketch while contemplating the zeitgeist, 'This Guy' expresses discontent with himself and his environment. Surrounded by a picturesque beach and depicting the 'easy life of white male privilege', the stones floating above his head respond to the Crypto market's real time data. This expresses a world which can economically raise above or crumble below, causing the anxiety of existing in our current age."	"Sebastiaan Edward Cator aka Quarck (*1992)

Sebastiaan Edward Cator holds a Bachelor's degree in Game Design from the Zurich University of the Arts, is doing a Master's degree in Computational Arts at Goldsmiths University of London and works as a freelancer in the field of digital content creation and interactive media. The works published under the alias Quarck deal with sociological themes and the interaction between reality and digitality, the search for new interweavings of different topics such as the creation of digital worlds and interactions relevant to everyday life. The artistic exploration and endeavour, the fascination for the incomprehensible, the discovery of new production and interaction possibilities drive him. Quarck moves freely in terms of media, but design and creation on the computer remain the most important elements for him."	quarck.studio		https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSFE0ucUrs475Vyo5HOIzEA	https://vimeo.com/quarckquarck	sebi@quarck.ch	quarck.studio	quarck.studio	quarck.studio	quarck.studio	Sub_ system 2: Ecosystems

"This video installation documents hoarding behaviour in common people as a persistent effort against the algorithmised cultural environment in China, where pieces of possession, speech and identity are prone to being censored, obsolesced, and erased. 

Participants are invited to film themselves packing and narrating the stories behind their collected items. An AI model is trained to perform object recognition on the footage and crop the items away by a random code-generated rule. As a response, the artist then prints out the remaining images fills in the hollow boxes with resilient bodies. 

Framed as a dig site of two empty suitcases, the installation captures the disruptive power of an algorithm and its inadequacy to preserve.

68	louie hext	louie hext	he	Complex Ecologies and GLSL Ants	Playful exploration of complexity and self-organisation  through interactive agent simulations. 	"Complexity is a broad phenomenon in which a system displays macroscopic properties that emerge from many simple local interactions. Examples of this include flocking birds or shoals of fish where each individual creature is guided only by the movements of its immediate neighbours and yet they produce vast dynamic shapes as a group. The simplicity of the rules and the resultant organic beauty has attracted coders and artists to emulate the behaviour - with a famous example being Craig Reynolds' ""Boids"". A step further from this is ""Self Organised Criticality"" where simple local interactions cause a system to move into a steady state, resulting in the formation of macro structures. Examples of this would be termite and ant colonies, as well as the famed physarum slime.

In this piece, a system of creatures that move and leave a pheromone trail behind them is created. The direction of each creature's movement depends on the intensity of ""pheromones"" in their immediate vicinity, allowing for each creature to guide and be guided by the other creatures. This feedback loop emergently creates a structured pheromone map purely from the small interactions. Crucial to this and the natural systems mentioned above is the amount of creatures in the system - with too few creatures, the system will be unstable and random; but with enough creatures, the randomness falls to spontaneous structure.

By interacting with the piece your motion and presence will unavoidably disturb the natural process of the creatures and their environment until they are no longer able exist within in it. How many species will be encountered and how many will have their habitats destroyed?
