Running through these varied forms is a post-factual viewpoint, which regards mythology, conspiracy and esotericism as immersive technologies in their own right, and attempts to understand the ways in which they can be leveraged to do work in the world. This stance is, at its heart, concerned with developing practical tools for survival in a world which increasingly defies human projects of mastery.

Combining these two, she is motivated to tell sensible stories through multiple mediums and the action of inhabiting a place. Therefore, her latest practice focus on creating multi-sensorial experiences through physical and interactive installations, where the performance in time and space plays an essential role.  

Her collection of work revolves around intimate experiences, memory, identity, culture, mythology and nature.

She is using technology to develop this variations but also to reconnect us with that sensorial aspect that is essential for humanity.  

In the past, she worked in architecture, photography and education in a University in the Design Department. She has been a finalist in several national and international photography grants.

",description:`Complexity is a broad phenomenon in which a system displays macroscopic properties that emerge from many simple local interactions. Examples of this include flocking birds or shoals of fish where each individual creature is guided only by the movements of its immediate neighbours and yet they produce vast dynamic shapes as a group. The simplicity of the rules and the resultant organic beauty has attracted coders and artists to emulate the behaviour - with a famous example being Craig Reynolds' "Boids". A step further from this is "Self Organised Criticality" where simple local interactions cause a system to move into a steady state, resulting in the formation of macro structures. Examples of this would be termite and ant colonies, as well as the famed physarum slime.

In this piece, a system of creatures that move and leave a pheromone trail behind them is created. The direction of each creature's movement depends on the intensity of "pheromones" in their immediate vicinity, allowing for each creature to guide and be guided by the other creatures. This feedback loop emergently creates a structured pheromone map purely from the small interactions. Crucial to this and the natural systems mentioned above is the amount of creatures in the system - with too few creatures, the system will be unstable and random; but with enough creatures, the randomness falls to spontaneous structure.

By interacting with the piece your motion and presence will unavoidably disturb the natural process of the creatures and their environment until they are no longer able exist within in it. How many species will be encountered and how many will have their habitats destroyed?
