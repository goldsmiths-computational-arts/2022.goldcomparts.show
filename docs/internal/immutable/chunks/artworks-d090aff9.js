It is London that is filmed, it is used as a material, an alphabet with which a language is built. Code is incorporated into the structure of the stories, guided by an Object Oriented Programming methodology.    This work is about what happens when a language is hybridised with another. The spectator never sees the character, they discover them through their perception of the city, and a voice-over narration of one of a thousand tales.  The purpose is to question how computation can be used to generate a grammar, with cities as an alphabet for a new language. Programming here allows us to get close an important aspect of cities. The fact that they are hard to grasp as a homogeneous entity, and that they are asynchronous, they hold at the same moment an infinite number of possibilities and experiences.  Code allows to convey this fundamental idea. Instead of developing a way to grasp its complexity, it instead shows a reality: cities are not graspable in a glance, and it is part of what makes them fascinating. It is also about using technology within the production of mediums that are already widely democratised and part of our common imaginaries. It doesn\u2019t challenge them with new imagery, but in the edition and production itself.

Examples of this include flocking birds or shoals of fish where each individual creature is guided only by the movements of its immediate neighbours and yet they produce vast dynamic shapes as a group. The simplicity of the rules and the resultant organic beauty has attracted coders and artists to emulate the behaviour - with a famous example being Craig Reynolds' "Boids". A step further from this is "Self Organised Criticality" where simple local interactions cause a system to move into a steady state, resulting in the formation of macro structures. The most famous example of this would be termite and ant colonies.    In this piece, a system of creatures that move and leave a pheromone trail behind them is created. The direction of each creature's movement depends on the intensity of "pheromones" in their immediate vicinity, allowing for each creature to guide and be guided by the other creatures. This feedback loop emergently creates a structured pheromone map purely from the small interactions. Crucial to this and the natural systems mentioned above is the amount of creatures in the system - with too few creatures, the system will be unstable and random; but with enough creatures, the randomness falls to spontaneous structure.  By interacting with the piece your motion and presence will unavoidably disturb the natural process of the creatures and their environment until they are no longer able to survive. `,bio:"Louie Hext is a computational artist and developer, whose recent work involves creating physically generative systems and exploring complexity through interactive technologies.

Our brain, through time, morphs, and so do our memories.   The project is an interactive installation with multiple pieces that place the spectator in the position of a close family member with dementia by inhabiting an interactive white living room where his memories are present through light. It uses technology but also combines analogue pieces. Portraits around the space get distorted with human presence or action. Going against the idea of Cornell's permanency of the photographic image in time, the pieces in this installation unfix pictures and give the possibility to deteriorate, distort, change, and disappear as happens to us human beings. These are portraits more like life itself.   The project is also an allegory between our brain and the computer. It uses coding software in parallelism to the nervous system. Code is used to morph new images by overlapping pixels between archive family photographs. Memories are also personal self-constructions. Therefore,  live images/videos are obtained from the spectator transforming the portraits. Finally, a pixel analogue version is also part of the installation in a puzzle game. This time, instead of using a computational morphing code, the film records a person with dementia playing the puzzle. To decode and visualise the images, the spectator must place the white cubes on the projections, following up the steps of a person with memory loss and therefore experiencing and embodying his performance.   In this installation, all constructions through deconstructions belong to a cyclical process to create a valid reality of atemporal memories.

The project is inspired by Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela's frog experiment which shows the way we experience the world depends on our biological structure . So the world we see is not the only, but one of the thousands of worlds, like mantis shrimp has an alien vision that can see 16 colors, dragonfly has a compound and nearly 360 wide vision. With the purpose of letting people immersively experience such unique and multiple worlds, I use VR technology which changes our normal human's perspective to these ones in different scales and kinds. People will have an embodied experience of these different nonhuman worlds through multiple perceptions and body movements. In this project, I want to express that although we usually focus on our own world, there are lots of other nonhuman worlds which are in a symbiotic relationship with us. We humans are not the center or the only subject in this world.	Jinyuan Li is an artist and explorer with the background of graphic design and computational art. Her works specialize in the synesthesia of multiple perceptions and body movements, and involve from video, illustration to generative sound art, audio-visual performance, virtual reality and other digital or computational expressions. Her recent practices include immersive experience with other nonhuman perspectives, generative sound with neuromuscular and machine learning, etc.. Her works explore the combination between art and technology, and bring art and aesthetics into more aspects of our real life.	https://drive.google.com/open?id=17ZY1nuXC_5nA2cf3Uvzsv-Fx6EH6SMla	Virtual Reality (VR)	https://drive.google.com/open?id=1pI0I99owCSSoxSWNwrvOk6v02Obz-GYZ, https://drive.google.com/open?id=1EiQn_2eGeROYTuDY7is_yISuQcad-CZd	yurii_eoli	www.jinyuanli.net			jinyuanyouli@gmail.com	orange portrait	Mantis shrimp world	Dragonfly world	\r
