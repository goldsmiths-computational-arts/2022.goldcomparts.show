    <h2>Morphed Memories</h2></div>

  <div class="txt_wrap svelte-iqaq1c"><p class="svelte-iqaq1c">Maria Gracia Cebrecos is a Peruvian multidisciplinary developing artist with a practice in a mix of documentary+fiction photography and a background in architecture. Combining these two, she is motivated to tell sensible stories through multiple mediums and the action of inhabiting a place. Therefore, her latest practice focus on creating multi-sensorial experiences through physical and interactive installations, where the performance in time and space plays an essential role.    Her collection of work revolves around intimate experiences, memory, identity, culture, mythology and nature. She is interested in questioning the construction of what we normalised as “reality” and it's many possible valid interpretations. She is using technology to develop this variations but also to reconnect us with that sensorial aspect that is essential for humanity.    In the past, she worked in architecture, photography and education in a University in the Design Department. She has been a finalist in several national and international photography grants. In 2021, she won the Catalyst prize by IC Visual Lab, and her work was shown Bristol Photo Festival. Now exploring new computational instruments to tell more stories or tell the same ones in a different way. </p>

  <div class="txt_wrap svelte-iqaq1c"><h2>When memories get lost in space and time.</h2>
    <p class="svelte-iqaq1c">Morph means: "undergo or cause to undergo a gradual process of transformation". Our brain, through time, morphs, and so do our memories.   The project is an interactive installation with multiple pieces that place the spectator in the position of a close family member with dementia by inhabiting an interactive white living room where his memories are present through light. It uses technology but also combines analogue pieces. Portraits around the space get distorted with human presence or action. Going against the idea of Cornell's permanency of the photographic image in time, the pieces in this installation unfix pictures and give the possibility to deteriorate, distort, change, and disappear as happens to us human beings. These are portraits more like life itself.   The project is also an allegory between our brain and the computer. It uses coding software in parallelism to the nervous system. Code is used to morph new images by overlapping pixels between archive family photographs. Memories are also personal self-constructions. Therefore,  live images/videos are obtained from the spectator transforming the portraits. Finally, a pixel analogue version is also part of the installation in a puzzle game. This time, instead of using a computational morphing code, the film records a person with dementia playing the puzzle. To decode and visualise the images, the spectator must place the white cubes on the projections, following up the steps of a person with memory loss and therefore experiencing and embodying his performance.   In this installation, all constructions through deconstructions belong to a cyclical process to create a valid reality of atemporal memories. Therefore, there is no correct or incorrect portrait; all of them are possible. </p>
