I once read that we all have some sort of dementia. As we age, retaining our memories becomes more challenging as the complex neural connections that transmit signals between neurons alter. Wanting to remember, but as the nervous system signals try to reach their final destination, obstacles get in the way. Loose connections in the system make memories merge, and the desired action drops its initial purpose. It is a constant search for memories that are vanishing and mutating.

This room holds some of His memories, and visitors coming into the space will interact with them. By revealing, morphing and fading them, they will partially embody Him. As memories will only exist if there is a human presence to perceive them, walls will be the only witnesses when we are all gone. 

We might not be losing our memories; they are just morphing.  </p></div></div>

    <div class="txt_wrap svelte-9u9qya"><p class="svelte-9u9qya">Maria Gracia Cebrecos is a Peruvian multidisciplinary developing artist with a practice in a mix of documentary+fiction photography and a background in architecture. Combining these two, she is motivated to tell sensible stories through multiple mediums and the action of inhabiting a place. Therefore, her latest practice focus on creating multi-sensorial experiences through physical and interactive installations, where the performance in time and space plays an essential role.  

Her collection of work revolves around intimate experiences, memory, identity, culture, mythology and nature. She is interested in questioning the construction of what we normalised as вЂњrealityвЂќ and it's many possible valid interpretations. She is using technology to develop this variations but also to reconnect us with that sensorial aspect that is essential for humanity.  

In the past, she worked in architecture, photography and education in a University in the Design Department. She has been a finalist in several national and international photography grants. In 2021, she won the Catalyst prize by IC Visual Lab, and her work was shown Bristol Photo Festival. Now exploring new computational instruments to tell more stories or tell the same ones in a different way.</p>
