  <div class="txt_wrap svelte-iqaq1c"><p class="svelte-iqaq1c">Jay Treagus is a visual artist and researcher.  Operating in the spaces ‘between’ - particularly those opened by marginal technologies such as occultism and the trans-temporal rhetoric of afro-futurism - they explore the relationships between technology, belief and contemporary knowledge making.  Their work includes both digital and physical artefacts, installation, performance, and site specific interventions; as well as academic and fictive (hyper)texts. These forms coalesce around a post-factual position, which regards mythology, conspiracy and esotericism as immersive technologies in their own right, and the attempt to understand the ways in which they can be leveraged to do work in the world. This is a stance, which is at its heart, is concerned with developing practical tools for survival in a world which consistently defies rationalist projects of mastery.  They hold an MA in Digital Media from Goldsmiths University, and are currently awaiting the publication of their first paper. </p>

  <div class="txt_wrap svelte-iqaq1c"><h2>A Twitter Live Stream</h2>
    <p class="svelte-iqaq1c">“... rather than a momentary shock, [the digital] sublime extends in time, a relentless mix of pleasure and pain without relief [...] in contrast to Kant's imagery of elevation, lift and raising over or above. The terms that describe wallowing in internet culture (deep dive, clickhole, etc) indeed suggest a spiraling down into depths—despite the obvious lack of depth to the screens we use. Is there such a thing as depth to a sequential series of flat images?”  - Annie Dorsen  The aim of this project is to probe Dorsen’s question by creating a visual and auditory immersive environment that produces a state of both over- and under- determination.  A (near) real-time stream of images captured from Twitter is compiled and project large, so that the viewer’s peripheral vision is completely filled. The timing of the images is such that the viewer is only able to register them in retrospect, such that there is induced a feeling of constant psychological lag, which is never able to be resolved. This effect induces in the viewer a feeling of anxiety -- both of agoraphobia (as the images and meaning constantly retreat from their mental grasp); and of claustrophobia (as they are buried beneath the unending deluge of imagery and potential meaning). With all contextual cues removed the viewer is left disorientated within a sea of images which become both immanent and transcendent. </p>
